 DOOR: A Text-Based Objective Game

 The program is supposed to print a player and their location,
 then move them through a door into another area, and then print
 the player and the changed location. Unfortunately, it doesn't
 work yet.
 
 The problem can be in the Door::enter function or something else entirely.
