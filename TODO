TODO:

--> Figure out why Door1.enter(cPlayer) does not seem to change the room that
    cPlayer is in.

--> A set of functions to print things to the terminal rather than just use cout, so
    that statements may be gramatically adjusted ("You are standing" vs. "You is
    standing" while allowing for "He is standing" vs. "He are standing")

--> A pointer (or some such thing) from the Character class to the Area class that
    the Character is in. This way, we can get the description of the Character's
    surroundings without having to cross-check Character GetArea() values against
    every Area's GetID() values to find the proper Area object.
