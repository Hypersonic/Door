 *	This class is the class that contains all AI functions.
 *	It has to include AI for:
 *	 Reactions to people based on a "Friendliness" factor, preferable 0-100
 *	 Intelligent fighting AI based on the weapons that the NPC has. It has to be strategic!
 *	 Perhaps an "Intelligence" factor, 1-100, that changes how the NPC reacts to variou circumstances
 *	 AI to decide where to go next, if there is nothing else to do. There should also be a potential of staying in the same place.
 *	 AI for handling conversation (this will be tricky to implement, but we want the AI to be interesting to talk to. Perhaps see a chatbot algorithm?)
